<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Oh, wow! Look at me, a 50-year-old woman, completely clueless about life. I mean, who needs to have any sense of self, am I right? I've been just surviving instead of actually enjoying my existence, which is just fabulous. Now I get to flaunt my middle-aged divorcee status, with my not-so-empty nest and a glorious lack of employment. Can you hear the excitement in my voice? Oh, wait, no, that's just the sound of my soul fizzling out. But shh, let's pretend I'm not completely withering away inside..</p>

<p>You know, I'm really nailing this mental deterioration thing. 
  Maybe I'm just waking up from a lifelong slumber, where happiness and joy didn't exist for me. Isn't it amazing? I totally deserve a life that pleases me in every single way. But hey, is this garbage existence all there is? I'm dying to know. How do I stop being distracted by things like the state of the world, poverty, injustice, fear, and death? I need a master class in self-care, one that teaches me to completely ignore everything else, because screw empathy and concern for others, am I right?</p>

<p>You know what I really wish? I wish someone would hand me a divine blueprint, some godly knowledge that magically leads me down a path without disappointment, sorrow, loss, rage, and emptiness. That would be just perfect. But no, instead, I'm losing my mind over racism, misogyny, micro-aggressions, and worldwide anti-blackness. It's totally not overwhelming or anything. I keep trying to convince myself that it's my fault, because self-gaslighting is the best form of therapy. Who needs to focus on themselves when there are bigger problems in the world, right?</p>
